# The-E-Commerce-Website

The project is about robotics activities and products. I decided to make an e-commerce website with my team friend. Then we chose robotics area for working. We made an e-commerce website about robotics products. The project includes two parts: Database part and Web Interface part.

The project will contain detailed table structures, multiple relationships and built-in tasks for database part(“MS SQL”). We will make website interface part using “Php”, “Html”, “Css”, “JavaScript”, “JQuery”, “Bootstrap”, “Photoshop” Technologies (and many assistant tools).
